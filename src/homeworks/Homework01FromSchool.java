            Java is easy to write and easy to run—this is
        the foundational strength of Java and why many
        developers program in it. When you write Java
        once, you can run it almost anywhere at any time.

        applications that can run on a single computer or
        be distributed across servers and clients in a
        network.
            As a result, you can use it to easily build
        mobile applications or run-on desktop applications
        that use different operating systems and servers,
        such as Linux or Windows.
